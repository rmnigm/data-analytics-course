# Some info
All homeworks will be in English language - both for my and your practice of using this language to talk about technical problems. This will be really useful when you'll try to apply abroad.
Some tasks will be listed as a number of small problems, sometimes from other educational resources (e.g. LeetCode).

# Easy Tasks
## Merge 2 sorted lists
Implement a classical two pointers logic for merging two arrays. I've actually had this one on my first team matching with Yandex.Market!
[Merge Two Sorted Lists on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/ "leetcode problem")

## Binary search
Implement a simple binary search over list in Python. Consider all edge cases!
[Search Insert Position on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/ "leetcode problem")

## Balanced binary tree
Check whether the binary tree is height-balanced. You'll learn how to work with arrays representing BTs and how to traverse them (or optionally you can convert to other tree representations like nested dictionaries).

# Harder Tasks
## Median of two sorted arrays
Binary search advanced: find the median of two sorted arrays without merging them. This is a tricky task to manipulate different indexes and conditions.
[Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/ "leetcode problem")

## Merge k sorted lists
Merge task advanced: use the heapq to merge several lists in one. The complexity should be **O(nklog(k))**, where **n** is the length of the array and **k** is number of arrays. And do not use heapq.merge - this is cheating!
